# Active Context: Intune Deployment Toolkit

## Current Focus
The focus was on implementing client-side routing and creating the initial structure for the "Applications" management section in the frontend.

## Recent Activity
*   Installed `react-router-dom` library.
*   Configured `BrowserRouter` in `Front-end/src/main.tsx`.
*   Updated `Front-end/src/App.tsx` to use `Routes` and `Route` for defining page layouts.
*   Created a placeholder `DashboardPage` component (`Front-end/src/pages/DashboardPage.tsx`) for the root route (`/`).
*   Created the `ApplicationsPage` component (`Front-end/src/pages/ApplicationsPage.tsx`) for the `/applications` route, including a welcome message and placeholder buttons ("Add an App with Winget", "Add an App with Scoop").
*   Updated `Front-end/src/components/Sidebar.tsx` to use `Link` components from `react-router-dom` for navigation to `/` and `/applications`.

## Next Steps (Project Development)
Based on the updated `progress.md` file, subsequent development work could focus on:
*   Implementing the functionality behind the "Add an App with Winget" button (e.g., showing a search interface).
*   Implementing the functionality behind the "Add an App with Scoop" button (if Scoop integration is desired).
*   Adding functionality for adding custom applications (MSI/EXE).
*   Connecting the frontend actions to the backend API endpoints (e.g., `/winget-search`, `/execute-script`).
*   Developing the backend API logic to orchestrate the full packaging and deployment workflow.
*   Completing the `scripts/Package-MSI.ps1` script for `.intunewin` packaging.
*   Addressing security concerns (API endpoint, Intune authentication).
*   Implementing error handling and asynchronous operations.
